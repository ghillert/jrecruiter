Password Strength Factors and Weightings

password length:
level 0 (3 point): less than 4 characters
level 1 (6 points): between 5 and 7 characters
level 2 (12 points): between 8 and 15 characters
level 3 (18 points): 16 or more characters

letters:
level 0 (0 points): no letters
level 1 (5 points): all letters are lower case
level 2 (7 points): letters are mixed case

numbers:
level 0 (0 points): no numbers exist
level 1 (5 points): one number exists
level 1 (7 points): 3 or more numbers exists

special characters:
level 0 (0 points): no special characters
level 1 (5 points): one special character exists
level 2 (10 points): more than one special character exists

combinatons:
level 0 (1 points): letters and numbers exist
level 1 (1 points): mixed case letters
level 1 (2 points): letters, numbers and special characters
          exist
level 1 (2 points): mixed case letters, numbers and special
          characters exist


NOTE: Because I suck at regex the code might need work

NOTE: Instead of putting out all the logging information,
    the score, and the verdict it would be nicer to stretch
    a graphic as a method of presenting a visual strength
    guage.
