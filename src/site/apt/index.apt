jRecruiter - A job posting service

  This project provides a light-weight Java EE based job posting solution. jRecruiter uses
  the following frameworks and libraries:

  * Struts 2

  * Spring 2.5

  * Hibernate 3.2

  * Hibernate Search

  * Acegi Security

  * jMesa

  * jQuery

  * JFreeChart

  * Freemarker

  * DWR

[]

  As database backend Postgres is used. However, support for other databases is easily
  implementable since Hibernate is used for creating the table structure.
